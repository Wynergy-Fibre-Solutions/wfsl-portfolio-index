\# WFSL Portfolio Index



This repository is the authoritative public index for the WFSL software portfolio.



WFSL software is governed by deterministic execution, machine-verifiable evidence, and licence enforcement in code.

This index defines what exists, how it may be used, and how compliance is proven.



This repository is canonical.
