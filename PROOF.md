\# WFSL Proof of Verification



This document explains how Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd (WFSL) proves the correctness,

integrity, and composition of its software using its own enforcement tooling.



This is not a claim of security by assertion.

This is proof by execution.



---



\## What WFSL Proves



WFSL proves that:



\- Execution is explicitly invoked, never implicit

\- Undeclared surfaces are denied by default

\- Outputs can be made authoritative, not merely produced

\- Verification can be performed independently by third parties

\- Composition of multiple enforcement layers is reproducible



All proofs are generated by running the software.

Nothing is asserted manually.



---



\## How the Proof Works



WFSL components are designed to enforce each other in a deterministic order.



The canonical enforcement chain is:



1\. \*\*wfsl-shell-guard\*\*  

&nbsp;  Prevents unsafe or contaminated execution contexts.



2\. \*\*wfsl-evidence-guard\*\*  

&nbsp;  Emits deterministic, machine-verifiable evidence of execution.



3\. \*\*wfsl-admission-guard\*\*  

&nbsp;  Enforces deny-by-default admission of declared surfaces only.



4\. \*\*wfsl-governance-chain\*\*  

&nbsp;  Orchestrates and proves that all guards compose correctly.



This chain is executed automatically in CI.



If any layer fails, the proof fails.

\## Where the Proof Runs



The proof runs in public GitHub Actions workflows.



No private infrastructure is required.

No manual steps are involved.



A reviewer can:



\- Inspect the repositories

\- Inspect the workflows

\- Re-run the workflows

\- Verify the outcomes independently



---



\## What This Is Not



\- This is not a marketing demonstration

\- This is not a whitepaper

\- This is not a future roadmap



This is a live, executable proof.



---



\## Scope and Limitations



WFSL does not claim to solve every security problem.



WFSL proves:



\- Deterministic execution

\- Explicit authority boundaries

\- Reproducible enforcement



Nothing more.

Nothing less.

\## Verification Entry Point



Start here:



\- Repository: `wfsl-governance-chain`

\- Workflow: `.github/workflows/verify.yml`



All other proofs derive from this chain.
