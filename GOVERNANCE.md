\# WFSL Governance Doctrine



WFSL software governance is execution-first.



Rules are enforced in code.

Evidence is emitted automatically.

Verification is deterministic.



No component relies on:

\- Manual approval

\- Policy interpretation

\- External trust statements



Governance is observable and replayable.



This doctrine applies to all WFSL software without exception.
