\# WFSL Portfolio Index



\## Purpose



This repository is the \*\*authoritative index\*\* for the Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd (WFSL) portfolio.



It provides a single inspection entry point that enumerates:

\- What repositories exist

\- What role each repository serves

\- How governance is applied

\- Where inspection and evidence begin



This repository is \*\*descriptive\*\*. It does not contain code or policy enforcement.



---



\## Portfolio Structure



WFSL repositories are organised into clear functional layers.



\### Kernel Layer (Foundational)



Kernel repositories define reference posture and foundational intent.

They are slow-moving and documentation-only.



\- \*\*kernel-governance\*\*  

&nbsp; Defines governance principles, change control posture, and inspection orientation.



---



\### Sentinel Layer (Governance \& Assurance)



Sentinel repositories define \*\*behavioural constraints\*\* and expectations

that apply across the portfolio.



\- \*\*sentinel-branch-policy\*\*  

&nbsp; Normative branch protection and pull-request discipline.



\- \*\*sentinel-ci-baseline\*\*  

&nbsp; Normative definition of minimum continuous-integration expectations.



Sentinel repositories do not ship products.



---



\### Public Layer (External Presence)



Public repositories describe WFSL’s external posture in a non-promotional,

inspectable manner.



\- \*\*wynergyy-public-site\*\*  

&nbsp; External-facing site describing governance, scope, and operating posture.



---



\## Governance Model



All portfolio repositories are expected to:



\- Enforce protected primary branches

\- Accept changes via pull request only

\- Use squash-merge or equivalent consolidation

\- Maintain clear commit intent



Governance policy is defined in sentinel repositories and referenced here.



---



\## Tagging and Transfer



Repositories included in this index have been:



\- Stabilised

\- Reviewed for scope separation

\- Tagged with `portfolio-ready-v1`

\- Transferred together as a single portfolio operation



This ensures a coherent audit trail.

\## Inspection Posture



This index exists to allow an external party to:



1\. Identify the full portfolio surface

2\. Understand the role of each repository

3\. Navigate to governance definitions

4\. Trace evidence through version history



No private context is required.



---



\## Non-Assertions



This repository does NOT:



\- Claim regulatory compliance

\- Assert certification or approval

\- Describe operational capability

\- Represent contractual terms



It is an index only.



---



\## Status



Authoritative. Stable.



Changes occur only when the portfolio composition changes and must be made

via pull request.
