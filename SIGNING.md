\# WFSL Signing and Proof Model



WFSL components may emit signed evidence artefacts.



Artefacts include:

\- Deterministic execution payloads

\- Hash digests

\- Component identifiers

\- Licence context



Signatures bind execution to identity.

Unsigned execution has no authority.



Verification is offline-capable.
