WFSL FIELD EXECUTION LAYER — CHARTER v1.0



Status

Authorised



Binding

Non-revocable without Control Plane supermajority



1\. Purpose



The Field Execution Layer is the point at which WFSL governance, software, and truth systems meet physical reality.



This layer exists to:



Execute real-world work under deterministic governance.



Ensure field activity emits verifiable evidence by default.



Protect engineers from pressure to falsify, rush, or conceal outcomes.



Guarantee that physical reality is faithfully reflected upstream.



WFSL does not abstract away the field.

WFSL anchors truth in it.





2\. Scope of Authority



This layer governs all on-site and real-world execution, including:



Fibre build, civils, splicing, testing, and remediation.



Device installation, commissioning, and validation.



Physical inspections, surveys, and handovers.



Any action where a human interacts with infrastructure or hardware.



Explicitly included:



Engineers, contractors, and supervisors.



Test equipment outputs and logs.



On-site decision making.



Exception handling when plans meet reality.



Explicitly excluded:



Desk-only assurance.



Paper-only reporting.



Retrofitted evidence.



Remote assertions without field artefacts.





3\. Execution Invariants



All field execution under WFSL must satisfy:



Reality supremacy

What exists in the field overrides plans, forecasts, or targets.



Evidence before narrative

No explanation replaces artefacts.



Engineer protection

Engineers are never penalised for truthful reporting.



Deterministic capture

Work outputs are captured in structured, repeatable forms.



Failure visibility

Failures are surfaced, not hidden.



Any execution violating these invariants is invalid.





4\. Field Artefact Requirements



Every field operation must emit, where applicable:



Pre-execution state capture.



Execution artefacts.



Test outputs.



Environmental or constraint notes.



Completion or failure verdicts.



Artefacts may include:



Structured logs.



Machine-generated test files.



Timestamped records.



Hash-sealed summaries.



Photos or video alone are insufficient unless embedded within a deterministic artefact bundle.





5\. ProofGate Integration



The Field Execution Layer must produce artefacts that are:



ProofGate compatible.



Hash-sealed.



Independently verifiable.



Non-repudiable.



No field work is considered complete until:



Artefacts exist.



Artefacts verify.



Verdicts are emitted.



Execution without ProofGate output is incomplete execution.





6\. Engineer Authority Model



Within the Field Execution Layer:



Engineers have authority to halt work when truth is compromised.



Engineers may override plans when reality conflicts.



Engineers cannot be compelled to falsify or suppress outcomes.



WFSL backs engineers who protect truth.





7\. Relationship to Planning and Control Layers



The Field Execution Layer:



Feeds reality upstream.



Corrects assumptions.



Invalidates false models.



Upstream systems must adapt to the field, not the reverse.





8\. Prohibited Actions



Under this layer, WFSL will never:



Backfill evidence.



Reinterpret failures as success.



Penalise honesty.



Optimise speed over correctness.



Allow management pressure to distort field truth.



Any attempt constitutes a governance breach.





9\. Deterministic Success Criteria



This layer is successful when:



Field outputs are trusted without persuasion.



Failures are accepted as valid signals.



Engineers choose WFSL because truth is protected.



Physical reality and system records remain aligned over time.



Success is measured in alignment, not throughput.





10\. Authority and Continuity



This charter:



Is binding across all WFSL field activity.



Overrides informal instructions.



Cannot be weakened by commercial urgency.



Is enforced by the WFSL Control Plane.



Signed into force by execution.
