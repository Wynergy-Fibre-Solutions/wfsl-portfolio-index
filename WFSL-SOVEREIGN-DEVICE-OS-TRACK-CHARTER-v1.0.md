WFSL SOVEREIGN DEVICE AND OS TRACK — CHARTER v1.0



Status

Authorised



Binding

Non-revocable without Control Plane supermajority



1\. Purpose



The Sovereign Device and OS Track establishes Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd (WFSL) as a builder of execution-grade computing systems designed for truth, determinism, and institutional trust.



This track exists to:



Design sovereign devices and operating systems free from surveillance-first dependency.



Embed governance, verification, and auditability at the system core.



Enable devices suitable for critical infrastructure, engineering, and institutional use.



Protect users, engineers, and operators from opaque platform capture.



WFSL does not build consumer distraction devices or data-extraction platforms.





2\. Scope of Authority



This track governs:



Device architecture and hardware trust boundaries.



Operating system kernels, boot chains, and update logic.



Secure execution environments and evidence emission.



Identity, attestation, and device provenance.



Integration with WFSL telecoms and infrastructure systems.



Explicitly included:



Engineering and field devices.



Infrastructure control devices.



Institutional and regulated environments.



Federation-ready sovereign devices.



Explicitly excluded:



Advertising-driven operating systems.



Surveillance-centric mobile platforms.



Dependency on closed vendor telemetry.



Dark-pattern UX and behavioural manipulation.





3\. Execution Invariants



All devices and operating systems under this track must satisfy:



Deterministic behaviour

System actions are reproducible and inspectable.



Evidence-first design

Execution emits verifiable artefacts by default.



ProofGate compatibility

No device claim exists without artefact backing.



User sovereignty

The operator owns the device, keys, and state.



Minimal trust surface

Only required components are trusted.



Violation of invariants invalidates the system.





4\. Architecture Principles



WFSL devices and OS designs must adhere to:



Verifiable boot and update chains.



Cryptographic identity anchored to hardware.



Offline-capable verification.



Layered privilege separation.



Explicit failure and recovery modes.



Transparent system state inspection.



Security is enforced structurally, not promised.





5\. Relationship to External Platforms



WFSL may interoperate with external systems for compatibility only.



WFSL will not:



Embed mandatory vendor services.



Require external identity providers.



Accept forced telemetry pipelines.



Allow update control by third parties.



Interoperability never overrides sovereignty.





6\. Revenue and Value Posture



WFSL does not monetise user data or behaviour.



Value is generated through:



Execution-grade devices.



Trustworthy operating systems.



Governance-embedded software.



Institutional and infrastructure adoption.



Commercial models are subordinate to truth and continuity.





7\. ProofGate Obligations



This track must emit:



Device identity attestations.



OS build and configuration artefacts.



Execution and update verdicts.



Security and integrity snapshots.



All artefacts must be:



Deterministic.



Hash-sealed.



Independently verifiable.



Federatable across WFSL systems.





8\. Prohibited Actions



Under this track, WFSL will never:



Conceal system behaviour.



Force updates without consent.



Embed undisclosed telemetry.



Trade sovereignty for scale.



Optimise adoption over integrity.



Any such act constitutes a governance breach.





9\. Deterministic Success Criteria



This track is successful when:



WFSL can deploy sovereign devices end-to-end.



Institutions trust devices without persuasion.



Engineers can inspect and verify all layers.



Federation occurs without central control.



Success is measured in trust persistence, not market share.





10\. Authority and Continuity



This charter:



Is binding across all WFSL device and OS work.



Overrides informal or commercial agreements.



Cannot be weakened by partner pressure.



Is enforced by the WFSL Control Plane.



Signed into force by execution.
