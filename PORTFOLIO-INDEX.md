\## WFSL Diagnostic Stack (In-House Tested)



\*\*Status:\*\* In-house tested under live, multi-carrier convergence  

\*\*Scope:\*\* Route quality sensing, evidence capture, deterministic gating



\*\*Components\*\*

\- wfsl-route-sentinel — Live route quality assessment (HEALTHY / DEGRADED)

\- wfsl-evidence-guard — Timestamped evidence capture of transient states

\- wfsl-proofgate — Deterministic decision gating (PASS / DEGRADED\_BUT\_PROCEEDABLE)



\*\*Validation\*\*

\- Tested in-house on live mobile networks

\- Multi-device, NAT-stacked environment

\- Observed degraded and recovered states

\- Evidence and decisions documented
