\# WFSL Portfolio Signal



\## 1. Overview



Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd (WFSL) maintains a controlled portfolio of infrastructure, governance, and licensing components designed to support regulated, auditable, and revenue-bearing digital operations. The portfolio is intentionally structured, versioned, and governed to support external review, compliance assessment, and future activation.



This document provides a factual signal of what exists today.

\## 2. Governance and Integrity



WFSL governance is anchored by a dedicated kernel repository that defines scope, boundaries, and decision authority.



\- Repository: wfsl-core-governance

\- Status: Stable

\- Releases:

&nbsp; - v0.0.1 – Initial governance kernel

&nbsp; - v0.0.2 – Governance boundaries and entry points



All protected branches across public-facing repositories enforce pull-request-only changes and linear history. Governance artefacts are treated as reference anchors and are not subject to iterative churn.



---



\## 3. Licence Engine (Evidence Anchored)



WFSL maintains a deterministic licence engine with preserved proof history and tagged releases.



\- Repository: WFSL-Licence-Engine

\- Current release: v0.1.0

\- Proof history:

&nbsp; - proof-licence-engine-20260102

&nbsp; - Deterministic sealing and evidence commits retained



The public export surface defined prior to sealing remains unchanged. No force pushes or history rewrites have occurred since evidence sealing. Licence evidence is therefore continuous and admissible.

\## 4. Public and Signal Repositories



WFSL maintains a small number of public-facing repositories intended to signal posture and readiness, not experimentation.



\- wfsl-web  

&nbsp; Purpose: Web-facing signal layer aligned with governance and licence posture.



\- wynergyy-public-site  

&nbsp; Purpose: Neutral, externally readable positioning and documentation with enforced PR-only workflow.



These repositories do not contain core licence logic.

\## 5. Current Status



WFSL is structurally complete at the governance and licensing layer.



Operational activation is intentionally staged. Core components are stable, versioned, and reviewable. No representations are made regarding timelines or commercial commitments in this signal layer.



---



\## 6. Activation Path (Non-binding)



Future activation, if undertaken, would proceed through:



\- Controlled onboarding aligned to governance scope

\- Licence issuance based on the sealed licence engine

\- Commercial enablement layered above existing artefacts



This document does not constitute an offer, roadmap, or solicitation.

\## 7. Scope and Limitations



This signal is provided for transparency and due diligence only. It does not replace underlying repositories, tags, or evidence records, all of which remain authoritative.
